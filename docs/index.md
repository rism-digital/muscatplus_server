# RISM Online Documentation

The RÃ©pertoire International des Sources Musicales (RISM) - International Inventory of Musical Sources - is an international, non-profit organization that aims to comprehensively document extant musical sources worldwide: manuscripts, printed music editions, writings on music theory, and libretti that are found in libraries, archives, churches, schools, and private collections.

RISM Online, a service from [RISM Digital](https://rism.digital), provides access to these musical sources through extensive search and browse functions. Multiple entry points, with extensive Source, Person, and Institution search interfaces, provide users with the ability to quickly narrow down relevant results using different approaches, including keyword searches, filters, and relationship information. 

While most users will interact with the built-in user interface, an extensive public API is also provided. This API provides machine-readable representations of all RISM data that are published on RISM Online. See the [documentation](api/api.md) on using the API for more details.
